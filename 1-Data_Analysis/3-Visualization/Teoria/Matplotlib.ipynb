    "We'll now take an in-depth look at the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) **package for visualization in Python**.\n",
    "Matplotlib is a **multi-platform** data visualization library built on **NumPy** arrays, and designed to work with the broader **SciPy** stack.\n",
    "It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) from the IPython command line.\n",
    "IPython's creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn’t have time to review the patch for several months.\n",
    "John took this as a cue to set out on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003.\n",
    "It received an early boost when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported Matplotlib’s development and greatly expanded its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have begun to show their age.\n",
    "Still, I'm of the opinion that we cannot ignore Matplotlib's strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine.\n",
    "Recent Matplotlib versions make it relatively easy to set new global plotting styles (see [Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Style Sheets](04.11-Settings-and-Stylesheets.ipynb)), and people have been developing new packages that build on its powerful internals to drive Matplotlib via cleaner, more modern APIs—for example, **Seaborn** (discussed in [Visualization With Seaborn](04.14-Visualization-With-Seaborn.ipynb)), [ggpy](http://yhat.github.io/ggpy/), [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/), [Altair](http://altair-viz.github.io/), and **even Pandas** itself can be used as wrappers around Matplotlib's API.\n",
    "Even with wrappers like these, **it is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib's syntax to adjust the final plot output.**\n",
    "For this reason, I believe that Matplotlib itself will remain a vital piece of the data visualization stack, even if new tools mean the community gradually moves away from using the Matplotlib API directly."
